go back to wireshark screen
in the filter field type one of the names of the protocol(one at a time) available to only see those packets
Repeat the above step for other protocols

Theory:

Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network in real time, or to analyze captured traffic offline.

Here's an overview of Wireshark and its features:

1. **Packet Capture**:
   - Wireshark captures packets from a network interface in real time. It supports a wide range of network interfaces, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB.
   - Users can start a capture session to capture all packets on a specific interface or apply filters to capture only packets matching specific criteria, such as source or destination IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers.

2. **Packet Analysis**:
   - Once packets are captured, Wireshark displays detailed information about each packet, including its protocol type, source and destination addresses, timestamp, and payload data.
   - Users can analyze packet headers and payloads to troubleshoot network issues, diagnose protocol errors, or identify security threats.

3. **Protocol Support**:
   - Wireshark supports a wide range of network protocols, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, DHCP, FTP, SSH, TLS/SSL, and many others.
   - It can dissect and decode packet data for hundreds of protocols, providing detailed information about each protocol's fields and values.

4. **Filtering and Search**:
   - Wireshark allows users to apply display filters to focus on specific packets of interest. Filters can be based on packet attributes such as protocol, IP address, port number, or packet content.
   - Users can also search for specific strings or patterns within captured packet data using Wireshark's search functionality.

5. **Statistics**:
   - Wireshark provides various statistical tools and features to analyze network traffic patterns, such as packet count, protocol distribution, endpoint conversations, and packet size distributions.
   - Users can generate graphical charts and graphs to visualize network statistics and trends.

6. **Export and Save**:
   - Wireshark allows users to save captured packet data to standard capture file formats, such as PCAP (Packet Capture), PCAPNG (Next Generation PCAP), or CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
   - Captured data can be exported for further analysis, sharing, or archival purposes.

7. **Customization and Extensibility**:
   - Wireshark is highly customizable and extensible. Users can customize the layout, color schemes, and preferences to suit their needs.
   - Wireshark supports plugin development using Lua scripting, allowing users to extend its functionality with custom dissectors, protocols, or analysis tools.

Wireshark is a powerful and versatile tool for network analysis and troubleshooting. It is widely used by network administrators, security professionals, developers, and students to gain insights into network behavior, diagnose network issues, and investigate security incidents. With its rich set of features and capabilities, Wireshark remains an essential tool in the arsenal of network professionals.
